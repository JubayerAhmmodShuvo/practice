/* Have the function StringChallenge(num) take the num parameter being passed and return all the numbers from 1 to num separated by spaces, but replace every number that is divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", replace every number that is divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", and every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz". For example: if num is 16, then your program should return the string "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16". The input will be within the range 1 - 50. */
