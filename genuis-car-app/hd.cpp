/* 
You will get an array of n numbers. Find out the k-th maximum number of the array.

Suppose you have 9 2 5 1 10. Here 1st maximum number is 10, second is 9, third is 5 and so on.

Input
First line contain n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), ai is the i-th number of the array.

Output
Print the k-th maximum number of the array.
